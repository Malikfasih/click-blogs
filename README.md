## Build a BLOG with Next.js 13 (Sanity v3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Auth, CMS, Preview Mode)

## Introduction

Built a fully-fledged responsive click-blogs site by:

- Dynamic page routing in Next.js 13
- Used GROQ query language to fetch the content from the Sanity Content Platform
- Embed, host & customize the Sanity studio on the website itself whilst protecting it via Sanity Authentication
- TypeScript to reduce the overall number of Bugs and Errors
